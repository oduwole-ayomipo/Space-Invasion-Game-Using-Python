### Overview
Space Invasion is a 2D game in which the player controls a spaceship (with the left and right arrow keys) in order to shoot the space aliens with lasers (which is activated by hitting the enter key). In odrer to record victory and continue playing the game, the player must aim to defeat all the space aliens before any of the space alien approachs the spaceship. When the player defeats a space alien, five (5) points is earned. The point is incremented on a successful kill. As more space aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement increases.

Similarly, the space alien will make attempt to invade the ship by moving in groups and at high speed to the spaceship. If the space alien succeed in reaching the buttom of the screen, the invasion has being successful. Hence, it's GAMEOVER!


### How To Play
- If you don't have [Python IDE](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Pygame Module](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) installed, you can simply double click the .exe file to play the game.
  **Note:** _The .exe file needs to stay in the same directory as the res folder_

- If you have the recent version of Python and Pygame installed, the program can be run directly via command prompt / terminal.
